#Notes from chat: Use triple quotes (""" or ''') to define a multiline string in Python. This avoids issues with line breaks 
# and makes your code easier to read. ALSO nstead of {input}, you should reference the elements of your story_one_inputs list using placeholders like {story_one_inputs[0]}, 
# {story_one_inputs[1]}, etc. since input is reserved method by python to take user inputs#
